Welcome to Magrittetorch, a modern software library for simulating radiation transport, using pytorch as backend for GPU computations.
This is a port of [Magritte](https://github.com/Magritte-code/Magritte) to python, to allow for a redesign of the parallelization scheme.
TODO: expand this introduction section

# Features
TODO: GPU computing, perturbation analysis, astropy input, and all other features of Magritte

# Documentation
TODO: the goal is to reuse the API of [Magritte](https://github.com/Magritte-code/Magritte), to allow for seamless transition to this library. Take a look at the [documentation](https://magritte.readthedocs.io) of Magritte instead for now.

# Performance comparison
TODO: compare CPU performance vs Magritte, compare GPU performance, scaling behavior

# Issues & Contact
Please report any issues with Magritte-torch [here](https://github.com/Magritte-code/Magritte-torch/issues). If you need any further help, please contact [Thomas Ceulemans](https://thomasceulemans.github.io/).

# Other sections
TODO: contributers, acknowledgements, citation, installation (this library will be written entirely in python, so pip/conda install should be possible). These sections will be added when magritte-torch is sufficiently developed.
