Analytic benchmarks
###################

Magrittetorch was tested against a set of analytic benchmarks, i.e. models for which an semi-analytic solution is known.
These models are described in `De Ceuster et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.1812D>`_.
The scripts to setup and run these benchmarks are provided with Magrittetorch and can be found `here <https://github.com/Magritte-code/Magritte-torch/tree/main/tests/benchmarks/analytic>`_.
